# Arithmetic Operators

print(40 + 2) # the answer is 42

print(43 - 1) # the answer is 42

print(6 * 7) # the answer is 42

print(84 / 2) # the answer is 42.0

print(6**2 + 7) # the answer is 43

print(2 * (3-1)) # the answer is 4
print((1 + 1) ** (5-2)) # the answer is 8

print(2*3-1) # the answer is 5 not 4
print(6+4/2) # the answer is 8 not 5

# String Operators

first = 'albus'
second = 'dumbledore'

print(first + second) # the output is albusdumbledore

print('spam' * 3) # the output is spamspamspam

# Binary

print(4 > 2) # the output is True
print(4 < 2) # the output is False
print(4 == 4) # the output is True
