#"=" assigns "I love Python" to variable "phrase"
phrase = "I love Python"

print(phrase)

#"%" is an arithmetic operator showing the remainder whereby "12" and "8" are operands

remainder= 12 % 8
print(remainder)

#"==" is a comparison operator which returns  TRUE if the two arguments are the same else FALSE

num1, num2 = 4,8
print(num1 == num2)

#the operator with the highest precedence starts and if more than one operator of the same precedence order are present then evaluation starts from left to right

equation = 2 - 8 + 2 * 2
print(equation)
