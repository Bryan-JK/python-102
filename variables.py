Write a simple script to demonstrate your understanding of Variable,identifier and keywords
'''


#Since an identifier can be the name of a variable hence, "integerNum" and "floatNum" are both identifiers and variables
integerNum, floatNum = 2, 3.8

#"if" and "print" are both keywords

if (integerNum != floatNum):
    print ("The numbers do not match!")
